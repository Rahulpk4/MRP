# MRP
Major Research Project on Connection Oriented Resource Allocation in Vehicular Networks
OMNeT++ is used for network simulation and message passing between nodes. SUMO is used for urban mobility simulation.
VEINS framework combines the two. The idea of the project is to use vehicles as infrastructures for their resource potential instead of relying on cloud. In order to allocate these resources there needs to be a methodology which tells how to allocate the vehicular resources. Factors and parameters that need to be considered. One of the main factors is connectivity of vehicles.
